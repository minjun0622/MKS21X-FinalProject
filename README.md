# MKS21X-FinalProject
1/4/19 The first half of the period was spent on branching tutorials. We were successfully able to create a branch and then merge it to master again. Then, we laid the foundations for the project by creating the files that we would need. There was a mistake of making a branch before making the files so it was fixed.

1/7/19 Minjun worked on the board class, where the board was made and plans to randomize the keys that will be printed out on the terminal. Chong worked on the Tiles class and set it up, establishing methods and boolean.

1/8/19 Chong reached further progress with the Tiles class. However, we came up with a class issue in Tiles. We debated whether a method was needed (toString), to change the values of the x in the 2D array. Minjun needed clarification on how we are going to know where the boolean (isBomb) is going to be used. We figured out that every x is going to have a boolean that predetermines whether it is a bomb or not.

1/9/19 Made further progress on the Tiles function. The board class was improved with extra tweaks. Mainly worked on the Tiles class because we realized that was the class with the most methods. Ran into a problem with class structure. Not sure if it extends or not.

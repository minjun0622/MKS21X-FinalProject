# MKS21X-FinalProject
1/4/19
The first half of the period was spent on branching tutorials. We were successfully able to create a branch and then merge it to master again. Then, we laid the foundations for the project by creating the files that we would need. There was a mistake of making a branch before making the files so it was fixed.

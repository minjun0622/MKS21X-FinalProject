# MKS21X-FinalProject
1/4/19
The first half of the period was spent on branching tutorials. We were successfully able to create a branch and then merge it to master again. Then, we laid the foundations for the project by creating the files that we would need. There was a mistake of making a branch before making the files so it was fixed.
1/7/19
We worked further on the project. Chong started the Tiles class and Minjun started on the Board class. The DevLog has been erased due to branching errors but it is going to be restored. 
1/8/19
We ran into a problem on class structure. We didn't know the instance variables and the methods that Tiles and Board classes will have. We didn't know where to put each of them. MineSweeper was started.

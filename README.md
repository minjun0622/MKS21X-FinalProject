# MKS21X-FinalProject
1/4/19
The first half of the period was spent on branching tutorials. We were successfully able to create a branch and then merge it to master again. Then, we laid the foundations for the project by creating the files that we would need. There was a mistake of making a branch before making the files so it was fixed.

Minjun worked on the board class, where the board was made and plans to randomize the keys that will be printed out on the terminal. Chong worked on the Tiles class and set it up, establishing methods and boolean.
